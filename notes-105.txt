0) we intended to bring up the webex that was announced, but we forgot this
   part. My appologies to those who were trying to tune in from afar.

1) we did a round table to do introductions and indicate where the person
   was coming from, and what kinds of use cases they cared about.

2) we had a lot of discussions about how to organize the use cases,
   and what made one use cases distinct from other cases.

A feature of the use cases that was initially discussed had to do with
whether the attester and relaying parties are online, offline (sneaker net?),
or use some kind of store and forward system to communicate (e.g. email,
delay tolerant networks, or ???).

It was felt that a major aspect of attestation was about validating the
machine that is doing the (biometric, etc.) validation of the human that is
authorizing the "Transaction".

There was a feeling that the kind/scale of the transaction would dictate
different kinds of solutions, and thus this should feed into the use
cases. The categories we came up with included:

### Government
### Financial institutions/transactions
### Large value financial transactions
### "James Bond"

A strawman example of was given of an IoT Toaster that had the ability to burn an
image into the toast.  The relying party was given as the owner of the
images.  This was later more clearly identified as being a Content Protection
use case, and that this use case needed to be more clearly articulated.

In discussing the Example of the Toaster, the question of device
bootstrapping at network provisioning time vs for ongoing use came up.

It was suggested that the MUD file/mechanism was a good place/way for a
verifier to learn the policy/reference values in order to do a verified boot
process.

But, the discussion came back several times to when the attestion checked/provided:
	* onboarding, provisioning, software-update, monitoring, data-use
	* question about when does the check become invalid/stale, and need to be redone

Fingerprint is attestation.... what is different between authentication and attestation?

It was stated that in FIDO, when you enroll, you register your device to and
then do biometric from that device to enable actions.
There is an attestation in the first step, but subsequently usually none
afterwards: the device use the fingerprint (etc.) to authorize an action, but
the initial attestation covers the correct operation of the device, which
does not need to be attested each time.
This was constrasted with ADAR (?) where the fingerprint *is* transmitted
across the network.  Privacy discussions of the different systems ensued.

It was pointed out that this requires attestation key material, which has to
be trusted by the verifying and/or relying party.
   The key that signs the evidence has to be trusted by verifier.
   The key that signs the attestation results has to be trusted by the relying party.

A use case for Critical Infrastructure was posited, such as access to sensors
in nuclear power plant, to actuators in a nuclear power plant.  There was
some discussion about relative risk of different actions, and that some
actions might not be as heavily authenticated as others, as they lead to a
safe state.
The example was given of sensors that might cause a vehicle network to engage
the emergency brake might not require as strong attestation, because it would
take too long.  {Ed: A vehicle which repeatedly make false stops would be taken
into for repair (malware removal), while a vehicle that failed to make
emergency stops would kill people.}

This was contrasted to Transfering millions of dollars (is user
authentication), where it is acceptable to take many minutes to confirm
everything is in order.

A positive attestation signal result changes your system trust model.
POSITIVE Attestation builds the trust model. FAILURE also updates it.
The trust model informs the system model.
    {Ed: deeper comments on this sought}

There was discussion of the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) example.
There are three levels of attestation:
      1) the NFV function itself
      2) the virtual machine container with (1) router functionality
      3) the physical device host that runs the container.
These systems are relatively isolated from each other, and this was
constrasted to an (MMU-less?) IoT device with minimal TPM functionality.

It was pointed out that currently you have to trust the brand, but later on
one will trust the signature on the hardware.
Each layer might have different layers of information.

This lead to discussion about Virtual TPMs.

The TEEP use case was brought up.
It was pointed out that it is a tree of components, and it was felt that this
made it a uniquely NEW USE CASE.

Additionally:
  - multiple applications over the top running on the same TEE.
  - chain, hardware, trusted firmware (trustzone vs SGX), different entities.
  - TCG - DICE certificate chain, root is the hardware, and each TA is a
  different leaf.  each entity signs the thing above it.
  - each layer has credentials.
  - when you attest the health of the application chain, it is for the policy
    to indicate which piece is out of date.
  - Trusted Application Manager (code and configuration of the code).  The
    TAM is a relying party.
  - there are a set of slides from TEEP WG and will be in RATS WG.
  - motivates having a set of levels of entities that are attested in the *SAME* message

I asked: Is the TAM the only consumer of the EAT?
  Within the TEEP WG, that is true,
  but not universally the case.
The TAM may be a path to a verifier.

The architecture talks about staged computing.

## Content Protection

Definitely a category of use cases!
- Play third party content on unit X. (User, Third Party Content, manufacturer of device)
- User content protection (only 6 people can read this email)
- "HDCP"

It was claimed:
   "Every use case for remote authentication is a use case for remote attestation"

The topic of

## Mutual attestation

and it would be a new category.  It was not terribly clear what this means,
but subsequent discussion clarified how it differs from two uni-directional
attestations.  The key point is that device A will not reveal its
measurements to device B until it sees device B's measurements.  And VV.
So some variation of zero-knowledge proofs may be required to make this work.

It was claimed:
   - authentication of a service is not attestation (valiating
     www.example.com certificate)

It was pointed out that with SGX it is possible to attest the enclave,
without saying which device it is, and this applies to some kind of cloud
situation where a service attests that it can do something, without revealing
where/how it is actually performed.

Then time ran out.
